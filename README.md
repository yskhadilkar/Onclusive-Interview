# Onclusive-Interview

Over here I have used the apachelogs python package instead of regex. 
Its straight forward instead of using regex which create complexity. As well as apachelogs directly supports multiple apache log configs - https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html

I am printing the exception block to showcase where the error is occuring to debug and analyse.
